# Task1
In this script, we first import the array module to work with arrays. We create an array called my_array of type 'i' (signed integer) with initial elements [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. We then demonstrate various operations on the array.

Accessing array elements: We access and print the element at index 2 using my_array[2].
Modifying array elements: We modify the element at index 1 by assigning a new value my_array[1] = 10.
Appending elements: We append an element 6 to the array using my_array.append(6), and extend the array with more elements [7, 8, 9] using my_array.extend([7, 8, 9]).
Deleting elements: We delete the element at index 0 using del my_array[0].
Finding the length: We find and print the length of the array using len(my_array).
Finding the maximum and minimum values: We find and print the maximum and minimum values in the array using max(my_array) and min(my_array).
Each operation is accompanied by a corresponding print statement to demonstrate the changes to the array.
